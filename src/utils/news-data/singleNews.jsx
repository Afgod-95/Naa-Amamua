            'LOVERS of High Life Music (LOGHA) have celebrated veteran Highlife musician, Mary Naa Amanua Dodoo popularly known as Naa Amanua for her unending and selfless work in the Ghanaian music industry.',
            'Naa Anamua was honoured at her home in Teshie-Nungua in Accra recently with a gold plaque, a citation, and an unspecified amount of money in appreciation for her works which have shaped the Ga culture and Ghana’s music at large.',
            'The gesture is part of LOGHA’s celebration of veteran Highlife musicians who have held the fort for a long time.',
            'In her appreciation speech, Naa Wulomei talked about her music journey which started in 1973 as a member of the popular Ghanaian music group, Wulomei.',
            'She later joined the Suku Troup when they released their debut album, Awo De Me. The Suku Troup toured West African countries such as Benin, Togo, Liberia and Kenya in East Africa.',
            'Naa Amanua left Suku Troupe after a decade to start her own group in 1988, and produced Mi Yen Maya in 1989.',
            'Naa remains active even though she is well advanced in age. She plays at important events and stole the stage with Highlife musician, Charles Amoah, during the 18th Vodafone Ghana Music Awards.',
            'In a chat with Graphic Showbiz, she said LOGHA’s honour means a lot to her. “It gladdens my heart to be honoured while alive because it means that my contributions are relevant and I’m appreciated,” she stated.',
            'According to the founder of LOGHA, Mr. Edward Owusu Benahene, honouring veteran musicians while they are alive makes them feel appreciated and loved than when done posthumously.',
            '“More of such honours and other philanthropic activities such as paying hospital bills, medical checkups are needed so that our fathers and mothers who set the pace for us will know just how much we love and appreciate them,” he said.',
            'Other veteran Highlife artistes who have been celebrated are Nana Nana Acheampong and the late Kwadwo Akwaboah, AB Crentsil and Nana Kwame Ampadu before they died.',
